# Introduction

A tool for encoding and publishing podcast content and assets. Inspired
by [bv-publish](https://github.com/stuartlangridge/bv-publish) and the
talk [Stuart Langridge gave at Oggcamp 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG6-YdBbwE8).

Project created by [Ubuntu Podcast](http://www.ubuntupodcast.org) and
released under the [GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)
license.

# Snap Install

    snap install podpublish
    snap connect podpublish:gpg-keys
    snap connect podpublish:hardware-observe
    snap connect podpublish:removable-media
    snap connect podpublish:ssh-keys

## Ubuntu Podcast Setup

The snap `home` interface munges `${HOME}` and my use case for podpublish is to
use configuration files that contain relative paths to podcast assets, such as
audio files and artwork.

The Ubuntu Podcast team use Syncthing to sync all the show assets, therefore the
Syncthing directory needs to be symlinked into the podpublish snap data
directory.

Run the following, which will create the data directory.

    podpublish.encode-podcast --version

Now symlink the Syncthing folder containing all the assets and configuration.

    mkdir -p ~/snap/podpublish/current/Syncthing
    ln -s ~/Syncthing/UbuntuPodcast ~/snap/podpublish/current/Syncthing/UbuntuPodcast

## Basic usage

To encode a podcast.

    podpublish.encode-podcast ~/Syncthing/UbuntuPodcast/Configs/S11/s11exx.ini

To upload a podcast.

    podpublish.publish-podcast ~/Syncthing/UbuntuPodcast/Configs/S11/s11exx.ini

To upload a podcast with a future date, set `wordpress.post_status` to `future` and...

    podpublish.publish-podcast --publishDate='1970-01-01 00:00:00' ~/Dropbox/UbuntuPodcast/Configs/S11/s11exx.ini

(The format for `--publishDate` is `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`)

## TODO

  * Sanity check the number of tags before attempting a POST. 19 tags or fewer.
  * Add support for Mastodon links.
  * Add support for chapter markers.

# Legacy Installation

Here are the legacy install instructions which assume you're running Ubuntu
16.04 or newer.

## Install ffmpeg and pip

    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg git libavcodec-extra python3-dev python3-pip

There is also a good quality statically compiled `ffmpeg` available from [John Van Sickle](http://johnvansickle.com/)

  * <http://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/>

## Install Pillow build dependencies

    sudo apt-get install liblcms2-dev libfreetype6-dev libjpeg8-dev \
    libopenjp2-7-dev libtiff5-dev libwebp-dev zlib1g-dev

## Install crypto build dependecies

    sudo apt install libffi-dev libssl-dev

## Install podpublish

You can install podpublish system-wide or in a `virtualenv`.

### System wide

    git clone git@bitbucket.org:flexiondotorg/podpublish.git
    sudo pip3 install -r podpublish/requirements.txt

### In a virtualenv

These are the steps for installing on Ubuntu 16.04.

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-virtualenv python-pip virtualenvwrapper
    sudo apt-get install libpython3.5 python3.5 python3.5-dev python3.5-minimal
    mkdir ~/Snakepit

Using `virtualenv`:

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 ~/Snakepit/podpublish
    source ~/Snakepit/podpublish/bin/activate

Or using `mkvirtualenv`:

    mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 podpublish
    workon podpublish

Or using `virtualfish`:

    vf new -p /usr/bin/python3.5 podpublish
    workon podpublish

Install podpublish.

    pip3 install -r podpublish/requirements.txt

# Detailed Usage

This project is a work in progress and still somewhat hardcoded but
will soon be made into a generic tool useful to other podcasters.

## Encoding a single podcast

To encode an audio file to `.mp3`, `.ogg` and `.mkv` (for uploading to
YouTube, do the following.

The `skip` options, in the `.ini` file, will bypass encoding if set to
`True`.

  * Edit the example `podcast.ini`.
  * Execute `encode_podcast podcast.ini`.

## Publishing a single podcast

The `skip` options, in the `.ini` file, will bypass publishing if set to
`True`.

  * Edit the example `podcast.ini`.
  * Execute `publish_podcast podcast.ini`.

## Encoding a season of podcasts

To encode a season of audio files, from existing `.mp3` or `.ogg` files
, encode them to `.mkv` and upload them to YouTube, do the following.

  * Edit the example `season-to-youtube.ini`.
  * Execute `season-to-youtube season-to-youtube.ini`.

The season encoder/uploader expects derive the each Episode number from
the source audio filename and each episode Title from tags embedded in
the source audio files.

## Publishing targets

### YouTube API

The reference YouTube API provided by Google doesn't support playlists,
nor setting a publishing date, so [youtube-upload](https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload)
is used instead.

To upload to YouTube you'll need a Google account with associated
YouTube channel, the YouTube Data API will need to be enabled and
OAuth 2.0 client-secret generated.

The Youtube API uses [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2)
to authenticate the upload. The first time you try to upload a video,
you will be asked to follow a URL in your browser to get an authentication
token. You can use multiple credentials, just use edit the option
`credentials-file=`. Also, check the [token expiration](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
policies.

If you plan to make a heavy use of the script, please
[create and use your own OAuth 2.0 file](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application),
it's a free service. Steps:

  * Go to the Google [Credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials).
    * _Create project_.
      * Project name: `YouTube Uploader`
      * Click _Create_
    * Click _Dashboard_ in the side panel under API Manager.
      * Click _+ ENABLE API_
      * Click the _YouTube Data API v3_
      * Click _> ENABLE_ at the top of the screen.
    * Click the _Credentials_ in the side panel under API Manager.
      * Click _OAuth consent screen_ from the top menu.
        * Email address: `you@example.org`
        * Product name shown to users: `Yourname YouTube Uploader`
        * Homepage URL: `http://example.org` (optional)
        * Product logo URL: `http://example.org/favicon_128.png` (optional)
        * Privacy policy URL: blank
        * Privacy policy URL: blank
        * Click _Save_.
    * Click the _Credentials_ in the side panel under API Manager.
      * Click the _Create credentials_ pull down.
      * Select _OAuth client ID_.
        * Application type: `Other`
        * Name: `youtube-upload`
        * Click _Create_.
        * The client ID and client secret will be displayed. No need to save them. Click _OK_.
        * To the right of the client ID you just created click the download icon. Save the file to your local system.
        * Use this JSON as your client secrets file: `client-secrets=CLIENT_SECRETS`

The following video may also be helpful in enabling the YouTube Data API
and creating client secrets.

### sftp

This is how to create an account, on Ubuntu, that has sftp access via
key based authentication.

### On your workstation

Generate a ssh key pair. This will create `~/PodPublish.key`
(the private key) and `~/PodPublish.pub` (the public key).

    ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -N yoursupersecretpassphrase -C "Podcast Publisher" -f ~/PodPublish

### On the server

    sudo apt-get install ssh
    sudo adduser --gecos "Podcast Publisher" --disabled-password yourusername

As `root` do the following on the server to create the `authorized_keys`
file.

    mkdir /home/yourusername/.ssh

Add the content of `~/PodPublish.pub` to `/home/yourusername/.ssh/authorized_keys`

    nano /home/yourusername/.ssh/authorized_keys

Set the `~/.ssh` file/directory permissions.

    chmod 600 /home/yourusername/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 700 /home/yourusername/.ssh/
    chown -R yourusername: /home/yourusername/.ssh
